What Skincare Products Work Best for Different Skin Types?

This project analyzes a large dataset of skincare product reviews to better understand how different factors influence product ratings and recommendations. The goal is to explore whether characteristics such as skin type, price, and product size impact how users rate and recommend skincare products.
The analysis was completed using Python in Jupyter Notebook and focuses on uncovering practical insights that could be useful for both consumers and skincare brands.

Dataset
Dataset name : reviews_1250-end.csv

Description :
The dataset contains tens of thousands of online skincare product reviews, including star ratings, recommendation status, product prices, skin type information, and review text.

Size:
Original dataset : ~50,000 reviews
Final cleaned dataset used in analysis: 26,108 reviews

Source:
Public skincare review dataset (original source provided in course materials)

Research Questions
This project focuses on answering the following questions:
Do product ratings differ by skin type?
Does product price impact average ratings?
Does product size (mini vs full-size) affect ratings?
Are higher-rated products more likely to be recommended?

Methods & Tools
Language: Python
Environment: Jupyter Notebook
Libraries Used:
pandas
numpy
matplotlib
seaborn
scipy

Key methods include data cleaning, feature engineering, descriptive statistics, visualizations, and statistical testing.

Key Findings
Most skincare products receive high ratings (4–5 stars).
Skin type does not meaningfully change rating behavior.
Price has a weak relationship with ratings.
Product size significantly impacts ratings, with full-size products receiving higher ratings
(p-value = 1.12 × 10⁻⁸).
A large majority of products are recommended, aligning with the overall high ratings.
